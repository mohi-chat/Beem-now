# Beem-now
install MondoDb. (Just follow the set up tutorial on the website.)

pull the repository and git checkout dev.

cd into the repo root folder and run npm start.

now open localhost:3000 and localhost:3001

3001- should show BEEM NOW (If you don't see this, most probably your DB setup has failed.)

3000 should show the frontend login screen (I don't think you'll face any problems here. This code currently compiles. So you should see the login screen at the least)

If you can see both the pages then you've set up the development env succesfully.
